# Advent of code 2021

My solutions to 2020 Advent of Code. For Haskell files I have not uploaded all the stack gubbins to the repository instead just the `Main.hs` file. 

##Run Instructions

To create the stack file install `stack` using

```
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```

Then create a new stack file for the day using:

```
stack new day[x]
```
Replace the contents of `app/Main.hs` with the Haskell code in this repository and run with

```
stack run
```

If a specific function wants to be tested out please use 

```
stack repl
```
